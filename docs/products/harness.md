## How to make a new harness

1. Make a folder for the part number of your harness somewhere on your computer. Run Harnice Render, which will generate an example harness that you can then edit.

    ??? info "Rendering a Product"

        {% include-markdown "fragments/how-to-render.md" %}

    You can also lightweight render if you want to bypass some of the checks.

    ??? info "Lightweight Rendering a Product"

        {% include-markdown "fragments/lightweight_rendering.md" %}

1. Edit the attributes of your new harness.

    ??? info "Editing the Attributes of a Product"

        {% include-markdown "fragments/editing_attributes.md" %}

1. Edit the formboard graph of your new harness.

    ??? info "Editing the Formboard Graph of a Product"

        {% include-markdown "fragments/editing_formboard_graph.md" %}
