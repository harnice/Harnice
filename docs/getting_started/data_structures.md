# How Data is Organized in Harnice

Harnice uses common file formats to store all of its data to improve portability and ease of interaction. Common formats in Harnice...
 - .csv (comma-separated value)
 - .tsv (tab-separated value; like csv but you can have commas in your data)
 - .py (plaintext file that contains Python syntax)

There are some standard file structures, called out by special names, that are used across many products. Regardless of the product type, the file should more or less do the same thing.
