    0: running git: 

    1. install homebrew: https://brew.sh/
    2. install git: https://git-scm.com/downloads
    3. git clone: https://github.com/kenyonshutt/harnice

***********
1. update your environment variables to point Harnice towards your libararies. here's an example:
    :
        public=~/github/harnice-library-public
        user=~/Projects/harnice-library-user
    :
    add whatever other library you need here. pull components from that library by referencing them by "supplier" in your yaml. 
    you can use git or dropbox or whatever to control your libraries in a repo separate from harnice. 

*************
2. install python however you want

*************
3. install the following packages: (for example, install by "pip3 install x")
    pip3 install wireviz
    pip3 install dotenv
    pip install xlwt
    pip install lxml
    brew install graphviz

3a. if you get errors installing graphviz related to path issues, do this:
    1. in the same shell that you're running python from (bash or zsh), run:
        echo 'export PATH="/opt/homebrew/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bash_profile
    2. then apply the change:
        source ~/.bash_profile
    3. test it by comparing:
        which dot
    4. should have returned
        /opt/homebrew/bin/dot
    5. against
        python3 -c "import shutil; print(shutil.which('dot'))"
    6. should also have returned
        /opt/homebrew/bin/dot

***********
4. make sure you have real apps installed that interface with files that Harnice reads and writes:
    text editor to edit the yaml
    SVG editor (inkscape?)
    TSV editor (excel?)
