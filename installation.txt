***********
1. Install Homebrew (if not already):
   https://brew.sh/

2. Install git using Homebrew (not the .pkg installer):
   brew install git

3. Configure your GitHub authentication:
   brew install gh
   gh auth login
   (choose GitHub.com → HTTPS → “Login with browser”)

4. Clone the repo:
   git clone https://github.com/harnice/Harnice.git

***********
1. Update library_locations.csv to point Harnice towards your libararies. Make the file if it doesn't exist in the root of your harnice repo.
    here's the format:
    :
        repo_url,local_path
    :

    here's an example:
    :
        https://github.com/harnice/library-public,Users/kenyonshutt/Documents/github/harnice-library-public
    :
    add whatever other library you need in this document. pull components from that library by referencing them by their url for traceability purposes. 
    you can use git or dropbox or whatever to control your libraries in a repo separate from harnice, as you wish.
    local_path is used to point harnice towards where the files for that repo live on your computer, but is not stored in any part definition.

2. install python however you want

*************
3. install the following packages: (for example, install by "pip3 install x")
    pip install xlwt
    pip install lxml
    pip install sexpdata
    pip3 install PyPDF2
    brew install graphviz
    brew install poppler  # for pdfunite

3a. if you get errors installing graphviz related to path issues, do this:
    1. in the same shell that you're running python from (bash or zsh), run:
        echo 'export PATH="/opt/homebrew/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bash_profile
    2. then apply the change:
        source ~/.bash_profile
    3. test it by comparing:
        which dot
    4. should have returned
        /opt/homebrew/bin/dot
    5. against
        python3 -c "import shutil; print(shutil.which('dot'))"
    6. should also have returned
        /opt/homebrew/bin/dot

***********
4. make sure you have real apps installed that interface with files that Harnice reads and writes:
    text editor to edit the yaml
    SVG editor (inkscape?)
    TSV editor (excel?)
