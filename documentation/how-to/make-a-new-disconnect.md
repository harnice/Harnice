# How to Make a New Disconnect in Harnice
In Harnice, any time you need to add connectors in between harnesses, you're required to define the disconnect as a unique part number. Fundamentally, a disconnect part number defines the connector part numbers involved on both sides of the disconnect, the signals running on each of the contacts of the connectors, and which channels those signals are part of. You can reuse a disconnect part number across many systems, which helps to ensure cross-compatibility. When channel mapping a system, Harnice will validate if there are enough available channels through a disconnect to support the device-channel-to-device-channel mapping you're trying to achieve. 

1. Ensure your channel types are defined. *Harnice defines "channel" to mean a physical set of physical electrical signals that must be connected to each other. Channels may map to other channels, which later drives conductor, cavity selection, etc.* Each connector of your disconnect should contain information about which side has which direction ("a" contains "inputs", "b" contains "outputs" with respect to the disconnect itself, i.e. inputting into the disconnect)
